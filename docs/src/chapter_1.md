# Vehicle Electrical System Simulation

## Overview

This documentation describes the simulation of a vehicle's electrical system using **Simulink** and **Simscape Electrical** in MATLAB. The system simulates the electrical interactions between an internal combustion (IC) engine, an alternator, a battery, and various electrical components such as a rectifier bridge, smoothing capacitor, and voltage and current sensors. This setup emulates the charging and discharging dynamics typically found in automotive applications.

## System Components

The vehicle electrical system model comprises the following major components:

1. **Internal Combustion (IC) Engine**: 
   - Acts as the primary power source by driving the shaft of the alternator. When the IC engine is operational, it generates the torque necessary to produce AC power in the alternator.

2. **Alternator**:
   - A three-phase synchronous machine that generates alternating current (AC) when driven by the IC engine. This machine's field current is controlled to regulate the DC bus voltage.
   - Includes a **field control** mechanism to stabilize and control voltage output on the DC bus. This is achieved using the **Synchronous Machine Round Rotor block** in Simulink.

3. **Diode Trio**:
   - Converts AC current generated by the alternator into direct current (DC) for feeding into the alternator's field windings, facilitating regulated alternator operation.

4. **Rectifier Bridge**:
   - A 6-pulse bridge that converts the alternator's three-phase AC output into DC. This DC voltage charges the vehicle’s battery and supplies power to other vehicle loads.

5. **Battery**:
   - Stores electrical energy and provides power to the alternator field winding when the IC engine is off or when additional power is required. It also maintains system stability by buffering voltage changes.

6. **Indicator Lamp**:
   - Illuminates when the IC engine is off or when the alternator is not generating power, signaling an inactive alternator state.

7. **Smoothing Capacitor**:
   - Reduces voltage ripples in the DC output, providing a stable DC voltage for the electrical system.

8. **Current and Voltage Sensors**:
   - **AC Current Sensor**: Measures the current generated by the alternator.
   - **DC Current Sensor**: Monitors the current flowing through the DC bus.
   - **Voltage Sensor**: Measures the voltage across the DC bus to monitor the charging state and stability of the system.

9. **Load**:
   - Represents the vehicle's electrical consumption, including components such as lights, infotainment, and other electronic systems.

## Operation of the System

The vehicle electrical system operates as follows:

1. **Engine Off State**:
   - When the IC engine is off, the battery supplies current to the alternator’s field winding to keep it ready for operation.
   - The **indicator lamp** is illuminated, signaling that the alternator is not generating power.

2. **Engine Running State**:
   - When the IC engine starts running, it drives the alternator, which begins to generate AC power.
   - The **diode trio** rectifies this AC power to DC and supplies it to the alternator's field winding, turning off the **indicator lamp** since the alternator is now operational and generating power.

3. **Charging and Regulation**:
   - As the alternator generates AC power, the **rectifier bridge** converts it to DC, which then charges the battery and supplies power to the DC bus.
   - The DC bus voltage is regulated by the alternator’s field control. The field control mechanism adjusts the alternator’s output to maintain a stable DC bus voltage within specific limits.

4. **Voltage Regulation**:
   - The system maintains the DC bus voltage within a defined range, typically between 13.5 V (lower limit) and 14.5 V (upper limit).
   - When the DC bus voltage exceeds 14.5 V, indicating that the battery is fully charged, the current flowing to the alternator's field winding is reduced. This prevents overcharging.
   - When the DC bus voltage drops below 13.5 V, the diode trio reconnects to the alternator’s field winding, allowing more current to flow to stabilize the voltage.

## System Behavior Under Different Conditions

### Start-Up
- Upon starting, the IC engine drives the alternator, which generates AC power. The rectifier bridge then converts this AC into DC for the battery and loads.

### Normal Operation
- During normal operation, the alternator supplies sufficient power to keep the battery charged and to power the vehicle’s electrical load. The voltage sensors continuously monitor the DC bus voltage, allowing field control to adjust the alternator's output as needed.

### High Load Condition
- In situations where the load on the DC bus increases (e.g., multiple electronic components drawing power simultaneously), the voltage on the DC bus may drop. The field control responds by increasing the field current, boosting the alternator’s output to stabilize the voltage.

### Engine Off Condition
- When the IC engine is turned off, the alternator stops generating power. The battery takes over as the sole power source for the field winding and the vehicle's electrical load, ensuring the electrical system remains functional.

## Key Simulation Parameters

The simulation uses specific voltage thresholds to regulate power flow and prevent overcharging:

- **Upper Voltage Limit**: 14.5 V – If the DC bus voltage exceeds this threshold, current to the alternator field winding is reduced.
- **Lower Voltage Limit**: 13.5 V – If the DC bus voltage drops below this limit, the diode trio reconnects to the field winding, increasing current flow to stabilize the voltage.
